# "Free," in the context of FreeCache

FreeCache is a collection of free works - that is the goal of the whole
project. But, in different contexts, "free" has different meanings. This
document aims to define "free" in the context of FreeCache.

FreeCache and its works is free in two respects: free as in freedom, and free
as in money. Works that are free as in freedom grant everyone the right to use,
modify, and distribute copies of that work. Works that are free as in beer
require no payment to access.

For software works, they are considered by FreeCache to be free if they follow
the Free Software Foundation's four essential freedoms:

 - The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
 - The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your
   computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a
   precondition for this.
 - The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
 - The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
   (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to
   benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for
   this.

All software contained in FreeCache must be licensed under a Free Software
Foundation-approved free software license.

For non-software works, they are considered to be free if they are licensed
under one of the following licenses:

 - CC-BY (any version)
   - Gives freedom to use, modify, and distribute for any purpose with
     attribution
 - CC-BY-SA (any version)
   - Gives freedom to use, modify, and distrubute for any purpose with
     attribution as long as modifications are distributed under the same
     license
 - CC0 (any version)
   - Effectively places the work under the public domain

Crucially, the license must not prevent derivatives or commercial use. Other
licenses may be added to this list in the future.
